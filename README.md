### Introduction
This project was a brief two-day sprint where I completed the MVP for an app of my own conception.

I decided to create an app for storytellers (novelists, screenwriters, etc.) to assist in world-building. I pared down the idea to the simplest idea waiting behind all of the scalable potential and began work. Though the timeline was rushed, I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to explore features new to me using raw React and CSS rather than utilizing libraries.

What I was able to complete in two days was a full-stack web application that takes in input about a fictional world and saves the information to a user's account.

### What does the app do?
* Paper & Garden offers a user-friendly way to develop fictional worlds.
* It was built for creators to save and expand upon the worlds of their fiction.
* Users are able to fill out information based on the prompts and reference them during the writing process.

### Tech stack ( you can include logos)
New Skills: using React Hooks and creating custom hooks
* Front End: React, CSS
[React](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shareicon.net%2Freact-js-logo-react-js-117367&psig=AOvVaw2rzOutO75GAQwl8M42LRPG&ust=1582861473118000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCMDM89bo8OcCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)
* Server: Express, Node.js
* Database: mySQL

### Challenges that were unexpected
* Had to quickly learn React Hooks and how to create custom hooks
* What did you learn?

### Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app
* What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product)

### How does the app work?
* What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it? 
* OR What are all the place the data travels?  What happens to that data?
* Optionally include a diagram
* How does the tech stack come together?

### What research was required?
Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.
* Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
* What did you learn from the process
* What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
* Writing tests
* Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

### Any non-MVP tickets (optional)

### Code refactorings

### Performance Optimizations

### Additional features
etc

### Notes from your Sprint Retro
What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?
* Future refactoring?
* Additional dev ops considerations?
* UI/UX additions?
